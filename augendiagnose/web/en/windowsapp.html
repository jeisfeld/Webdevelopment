	<h2>The Windows Application</h2>

	<p>There is an accompanying Windows application that allows to visualize the eye photos on a Windows desktop like
		in the Android app.</p>

	<p>The Windows application is only intended as add-on to the Android app. It allows less features than the Android
		app. In particular, it does not allow to organize new photos and to set the position of the overlays. However, it
		allows to show the photos, show the overlays, and edit the comment.</p>

	<p>
		In order to use the Windows application, you have to synchronize the eye photo folder of your Android device with a
		corresponding eye photo folder on your Windows desktop. This folder needs to be configured in the settings.<br>
		One possible way of synchronisation is to install a WebDAV app on your Android device and to install some
		synchronization application on your Windows desktop (such as FreeFileSync). Then you can do the configuration in a way
		that the synchronization application accesses your Android device wirelessly via WebDAV.
	</p>

	<p>The Windows application has no feature to display two photos at the same time. If you want to do this, you just
		have to open the application twice.</p>
