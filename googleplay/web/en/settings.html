	<h2>Eye Diagnosis - Settings</h2>

	The application allows the following settings:

	<h3>Eye Photo Folder</h3>

	This is the folder in which the app manages the eye photos.

	<h3>Input folder for new eye photos</h3>

	This is the folder, from which the app imports new eye photos. By default, this
	is the EyeFi folder. However, you can configure here any other folder, such as
	the camera folder.

	<h3>Max Bitmap size</h3>

	This is the size to which photos are scaled down before displaying. This
	downscaling is required to save device memory. The default value is 2048. In
	devices with little memory, it may be required to configure a smaller value
	(such as 1024). Too big values may crash the application.

	<h3>Last photo is right eye</h3>

	Here you can define if the last photo is the right or the left eye. By default
	this is the left eye (which means that you made first a photo of the right eye
	and then of the left eye).

	<h3>User key</h3>

	A user key that allows unlocking of additional functionality.
