	<h2>Settings</h2>

	The application allows the following settings:

	<h3>Input folder for new eye photos</h3>

	This is the folder, from which the app imports new eye photos. By default, this
	is the target folder of the Eye-Fi app. However, you can configure here any
	other folder, such as the camera folder.

	<p>Background regarding the Eye-Fi app: typically, the camera of the mobile
		device is not sufficient to capture eye photos in high quality. A more
		practical approach is to use an external camera which Eye-Fi SD card, which
		transfers the photos via WLAN to the mobile device.</p>

	<h3>Eye Photo Folder</h3>

	This is the folder in which the app manages the eye photos.

	<h3>Max Bitmap size</h3>

	This is the size to which photos are scaled down before displaying. This
	downscaling is required to save device memory. The default value is 2048. In
	devices with little memory, it may be required to configure a smaller value
	(such as 1024). Too big values may crash the application.

	<h3>Last photo is right eye</h3>

	Here you can define if the last photo is the right or the left eye. By default
	this is the left eye (which means that you made first a photo of the right eye
	and then of the left eye).

	<h3>Save additional data in jpeg</h3>

	Here you can limit the storage of data in the JPG files by the app.

	<ul>
		<li>Store in EXIF (recommended): The app stores relevant information in
			the JPG file, even in standard fields which are visible in Windows.</li>
		<li>Store in custom fields: The app stores information in the JPG file,
			but only in separate fields.</li>
		<li>Don&apos;t store data in images: The app does not store information in JPG
			files. (This limits the functionality of the app.)</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>User key</h3>

	A user key that allows unlocking of additional functionality.
