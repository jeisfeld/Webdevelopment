<title>Eye Diagnosis - Settings</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h2>Settings</h2>

	The application allows the following settings:

	<h3>Input folder for new eye photos</h3>

	<p>This is the folder, from which the app imports new eye photos. By default, this is either the target folder of
		the Eye-Fi app or the standard folder of the Camera app. However, you can configure here any other folder.</p>

	<p>Background regarding the Eye-Fi app: typically, the camera of the mobile device is not sufficient to capture eye
		photos in high quality. A more practical approach is to use an external camera with Eye-Fi SD card, which transfers
		the photos via WLAN to the mobile device.</p>

	<h3>Eye Photo Folder</h3>

	<p>This is the folder in which the app manages the eye photos. Normally, you need not change this. From here, you
		can copy the photos to other devices.</p>

	<p>The predefined folder is &ldquo;EyePhotos&rdquo;.</p>

	<p>You can select here a folder either on your device memory or on an SD card. In Android 4.4 (Kitkat), storage on
		SD card has some limitations, therefore some operations will take longer.</p>

	<h3>Max Bitmap size</h3>

	This is the size to which photos are scaled down before displaying. This downscaling is required to save device memory.
	The default value is 2048. In devices with little memory, it may be required to configure a smaller value (such as
	1024). Too big values may crash the application.

	<h3>Last photo is right eye</h3>

	Here you can define if the last photo is the right or the left eye. By default this is the left eye (which means that
	you made first a photo of the right eye and then of the left eye).

	<h3>Save additional data in jpeg</h3>

	Here you can limit the storage of data in the JPG files by the app.

	<ul>
		<li>Store in EXIF (recommended): The app stores relevant information in the JPG file, even in standard fields
			which are visible in Windows.</li>

		<li>Store in custom fields: The app stores information in the JPG file, but only in separate fields. Standard
			fields remain unchanged; the data exchange with Windows is not possible.</li>

		<li>Don&amp;apos;t store data in images: The app does not store information in JPG files. (This limits the
			functionality of the app.)</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Default overlay color</h3>

	Here you can define the default color for iris topography overlays. (Standard: red)

	<h3>Language</h3>

	Here you can change the language in which the app is displayed. A value change forces a restart of the app.

	<h3>User key</h3>

	A user key that allows unlocking of additional functionality.
