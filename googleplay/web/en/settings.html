<title>Eye Diagnosis - Settings</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h2>Settings</h2>

	The application allows the following settings:

	<h3>Input folder for new eye photos</h3>

	<p>This is the folder, from which the app imports new eye photos. By default, this is either the target folder of
		the Eye-Fi app or the standard folder of the Camera app. However, you can configure here any other folder.</p>

	<p>Background regarding the Eye-Fi app: typically, the camera of the mobile device is not sufficient to capture eye
		photos in high quality. A more practical approach is to use an external camera with Eye-Fi SD card, which transfers
		the photos via WLAN to the mobile device.</p>

	<h3>Eye Photo Folder</h3>

	<p>This is the folder in which the app manages the eye photos. Normally, you need not change this. From here, you
		can copy the photos to other devices.</p>

	<p>The predefined folder is &ldquo;EyePhotos&rdquo;.</p>

	<p>You can select here a folder either on your device memory or on an SD card. In Android 4.4 (Kitkat), storage on
		SD card has some limitations, therefore some operations will take longer.</p>

	<h3>Last photo is right eye</h3>

	Here you can define if the last photo is the right or the left eye. By default this is the left eye (which means that
	you made first a photo of the right eye and then of the left eye).

	<h3>Sort by last name</h3>

	Here you may decide that names are not ordered strictly alphabetically as given, but by the last name.

	<h3>Max Bitmap size</h3>

	This is the size to which photos are scaled down before displaying. This downscaling is required to save device memory.
	The default value is 2048. In devices with little memory, it may be required to configure a smaller value (such as
	1024). Too big values may crash the application.

	<h3>Show image in full resolution</h3>

	Here you can decide under which circumstances the photo is displayed in full resolution, which allows to see more
	details on the photo, but consumes memory and computing time.

	<ul>
		<li>Always load automatically: The app always stores the photos in full resolution in memory. This gives the best
			user experience on high end devices, but may lead to crashes if there is not enough memory available.</li>

		<li>Load automatically when displaying single photo: The app shows full resolution only when displaying a single
			image. This requires half of the memory.</li>

		<li>Load only on demand: The app does not show the image in full resolution. This requires least memory and CPU,
			but details in the photo may be lost. The &ldquo;magnifier&rdquo; button allows to display the current picture detail
			in full resolution.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Save additional data in jpeg</h3>

	Here you can limit the storage of data in the JPG files by the app.

	<ul>
		<li>Store in EXIF (recommended): The app stores relevant information in the JPG file, even in standard fields
			which are visible in Windows.</li>

		<li>Store in custom fields: The app stores information in the JPG file, but only in separate fields. Standard
			fields remain unchanged; the data exchange with Windows is not possible.</li>

		<li>Don&amp;apos;t store data in images: The app does not store information in JPG files. (This limits the
			functionality of the app.)</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Default overlay color</h3>

	Here you can define the default color for iris topography overlays. (Standard: red)

	<h3>Language</h3>

	Here you can change the language in which the app is displayed. A value change forces a restart of the app.

	<h3>User key</h3>

	A user key that allows unlocking of additional functionality.
