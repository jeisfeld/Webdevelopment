	<h2>Eye Diagnosis - Overview</h2>

	This App has the purpose to support the visualization of eye photographs on an
	Android device, in order to do medical diagnosis.

	<h3>Key Features</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>Organization of eye photos by name, date and side (right/left)</li>

		<li>Display of two eye photos in parallel (with full support of
			individual resizing), so that comparisons are possible (such as right-left
			comparison, earlier-later comparison, different person comparison, or
			comparison to an iris topography).</li>

		<li>Change of brightness and contrast of the photo during display, and
			overlay with an iris topography.</li>
	</ul>

	This is just an alpha version of the app. Further features are to come. Ideas
	for further features are welcome.

	<h3>Main activities</h3>

	<h4>Step 1: Organize the photos.</h4>

	<p>In this step, you can organize eye photos.</p>

	<p>The App expects new eye photos in an input folder which is preconfigued
		as the target folder of the Eye-Fi app, but can be changed via the settings.</p>

	<p>In the "Organize new photos" activity, you can assign new eye photos
		from the input folder to a person and a date and prepare them in this way for
		the app. Then the photos will be renamed and moved to the eye photo folder.</p>

	<p>As an alternative, you may select two photos in a file browser or photo
		app and send these photos to the Eye Diagnosis app. Then you can organize
		these photos in the app. In this case, the photos will not be deleted from
		their old location.</p>

	<h4>Step 2: Visualize the photos.</h4>

	<p>This is the main purpose of the app, but it requires the photos to be
		organized via step 1.</p>

	<p>In this activity, you can</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Show one of the photos in detail. Here you can also change brightness
			and contrast of the photo, show iris topographies as overlay, or write
			a comment to a photo.</li>

		<li>Display two photos for comparison (and pinch them independently).</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Data storage</h3>

	<p>The app stores information (like iris position or comments) directly in
		the JPG image files. This has the advantage that all such information is still
		available if you copy the pictures from one device to another one. To some
		extent, information like comments will be even available when viewing the
		files in MS Windows.</p>

	<p>However, this kind of storage imposes a small risk. It may happen that
		on some devices, or for pictures from some cameras, it may happen that storing
		information in the JPG fails, or possibly even destroys the JPG file.
		Therefore, it is recommended that you keep backups of your JPG files at least
		when using the app for the first time with a new device or with a new camera.</p>
