<title>Eye Diagnosis - Visualize Photos</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h2>Visualize the photos</h2>

	<p>In this activity, you can select the name of a person whose eye photos
		you want to see. Then you get shown all eye photos of this person in a list
		sorted by date.</p>

	<p>Then you have the following possibilities:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Show one of the photos in detail (via click on a photo). In this view
			you may also change brightness and contrast of the photo or show iris
			topographies as overlay. (Note: due to copyright, there are currently only
			two self-made iris topographies delivered with the app.)</li>

		<li>Show both photos of one date (via click on a date)</li>

		<li>Show two photos of different dates (via long click on one photo and
			click on a second photo)</li>

		<li>Show two photos of different persons: Select one photo of this person
			(via long click) and then select a photo of a different person for
			comparison.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Note that iris topography graphics may be organized just like eye photos
		- this allows to compare eye photos with iris topography graphics. Such
		graphics are not included in the app due to copyright reasons.</p>
