<title>Eye Diagnosis - Visualize Photos</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h2>Visualize the photos</h2>

	<p>In this activity, you can select the name of a person whose eye photos you want to see. Then you get shown all
		eye photos of this person in a list sorted by date.</p>

	<p>Then you have the following possibilities:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Show one of the photos in detail (via click on a photo).</li>

		<li>Show both photos of one date (via click on a date)</li>

		<li>Show two photos of different dates (via long click on one photo and click on a second photo)</li>

		<li>Show two photos of different persons: Select one photo of this person (via long click) and then select a
			photo of a different person.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Note that iris topography graphics may be organized just like eye photos - this allows to compare eye photos
		with iris topography graphics. Such graphics are not included in the app (except as overlays).</p>

	<h3>Further options in the overview</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>When making a long click on a name in the list of names, you may change or delete the name</li>

		<li>When making a long click on a date in the list of pictures for a name, you may change the date or delete the
			pictures of that date, or you may move these pictures back to the input folder (e.g. in order to move them to a
			different name).</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Further options in the detail view</h3>

	<p>In the detail view (one or two photos), you have the following further possibilities:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Change of brightness and contrast via sliders</li>

		<li>Display of iris topographies as overlay, adaption of the overlay to the iris and storage of overlay position
			(lock button)</li>

		<li>Store the selected settings of brightness and contrast (via &ldquo;save&rdquo; button on action bar)</li>

		<li>Store the position and zoom (via &ldquo;save&rdquo; button on action bar)</li>

		<li>Change the comment of the photo (via &ldquo;document&rdquo; button on action bar)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>These features may be enabled or disabled via the context menu (long click on photo) at &ldquo;Show/Hide
		utilities&rdquo;.</p>
