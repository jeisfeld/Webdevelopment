	<h2>How to use</h2>

	<p>This app displays surprise images from image lists that you configure. Therefore, you first have to configure an
		image list before you can enjoy the display of surprise images.</p>

	<h3>Setup of the image list</h3>

	<h4>First steps</h4>

	<p>
		When you open the app for the first time, an empty image list is created, and you see the setup page for this list. On
		this page, you may press the icon <img src="../drawable/ic_action_plus.png" /> in order to add images to the list.
		Select the folder from which you want to add images to the list. Then the list of images in this folder gets
		displayed, and you have the following alternatives:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><b>Add the whole folder:</b> This is the easiest way to get many images into your list. To do this, press the
			icon <img src="../drawable/ic_action_add_folder.png" />.</li>
		<li><b>Add individual images:</b> This is a bit more laborious, but more flexible. Just select all images that
			you want to add, and then press the icon <img src="../drawable/ic_action_add_checked.png" /></li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		After you have added folders and images to your list in this way, you can try all variants to
		<a href="#viewImages">view the images.</a>
	</p>

	<h4>Opening the configuration page</h4>

	<p>At a later time, you may want to add further images to your list, or to remove images from your list.</p>

	<p>Generally, in order to configure your image list, you have to open the configuration page of the list. You can
		access this page in the following ways:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>By double tapping on an image while viewing it.</li>
		<li>By long pressing on an image while viewing it, and then pressing &ldquo;Display image list&rdquo;.</li>
		<li>By adding the launcher for the surprise image configuration to your home screen. (This is a second launcher
			provided by the app.)</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Adding images to the surprise image list</h4>

	<p>If you want to add images to your list, there are the following options:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>On the image list configuration page, press the icon <img src="../drawable/ic_action_plus.png" /> - then you
			can add folders or images as in the beginning. This is the only way in which you can add whole folders.
		</li>
		<li>While browsing the folders, you may make a long press on a folder name - this allows to add this folder
			quickly to the image list without looking into its contents. This is helpful if you want to add many folders.</li>
		<li>Alternatively, you may display a photo in the gallery app and send the image from there to the Surprise Image
			app.</li>
		<li>Or, you may select multiple images in the gallery app and send them at once to the Surprise Image app. This
			is the easiest way to add many individual images from the same folder.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Removing images from the surprise image list</h4>

	<p>If you want to remove images from your list, there are the following options:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>On the image list configuration page, press the icon <img src="../drawable/ic_action_minus.png" />. Then
			select the folders and images that you want to remove from the list. Then press the icon <img
			src="../drawable/ic_action_remove_checked.png" /> to remove them.
		</li>
		<li>Here, you may also press the icon <img src="../drawable/ic_action_checkbox.png" /> to select all folders and
			images in the list. This is helpful if you want to remove the majority of images.
		</li>
		<li>Alternatively, while viewing an image, you may long press on the image, and then select &ldquo;Remove image
			from list&rdquo; in order to remove the image that you are viewing. This is possible only for images that are added
			individually to the image list - folders always stay as a whole in the list.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>
		<a name="viewImages"></a>
		View the images
	</h3>

	<h4>Viewing surprise images via the launcher</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>If you press the launcher icon, the app will start displaying a random image from your surprise image list on
			full screen.</li>
		<li>If you want to see more details, just zoom as usual with two fingers.</li>
		<li>If you want to see a different image from the list, just flip the image away.</li>
		<li>You can go one image back by flipping in the other direction.</li>
		<li>If you want to know the file location of this image, make a long press on the image. From here, you may also
			send the image (e.g. via email).</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Using widgets</h4>

	There are three types of widgets that you can place on your home screen in order to see surprise images.

	<ul>
		<li><b>Surprise Image Widget:</b> This widget behaves like the launcher, as long as you have only one image list.
			If you have multiple image lists configured, then the Surprise Image Widget allows to display a surprise image of a
			specific image list.</li>
		<li><b>Surprise Image Frame:</b> This widget places one of the images of your list on the home screen. When
			placing the widget on your home screen, you can specify how frequently a new surprise image should be displayed.</li>
		<li><b>Surprise Image Deck:</b> This widget places the images of your list in random order as a card deck on the
			home screen. You can move from one image to the next. When placing the widget on your home screen, you can specify
			how frequently the pile should be re-shuffled.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>If you tap on the Surprise Image Frame or the Surprise Image Deck, then you can see the displayed photo in
		detail. From here, you may flip the image away in order to see other images from the same list, or you may open the
		configuration page for this list.</p>

	<p>The Surprise Image Frame also allows you to switch to a new random image (via tap on the right border of the
		frame), or to change the configuration of the frame (via tap on the left border of the frame).</p>

	<p>If you have multiple image lists (which requires premium add-on), then you can place widgets for multiple image
		lists on your home screen, so for example you may have always a photo of your spouse and a photo of your last vacation
		in parallel on your screen.</p>
	<p>Please note that directly after a reboot of the phone or tablet, the external SD card is not yet accessible.
		Therefore, after a reboot, the widgets can only display images from internal phone memory. If you want to see a nice
		image directly after reboot, you should add one nice photo from internal phone memory to each of your image lists.</p>
	<p>The widgets may update the image more frequently than specified (dependent on the Android system).</p>

	<h3>Use of multiple image lists (Premium)</h3>

	<p>
		Via the icon <img src="../drawable/ic_action_folder.png" /> you can access the menu for handling multiple image
		lists. It contains the following entries:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><b>Switch image list:</b> As soon as you have more than one image list, you can use this menu item to select
			another image list in the configuration. The selected list will also be used by the launcher.</li>
		<li><b>Create new image list:</b> Here you can create a new empty image list.</li>
		<li><b>Clone current image list:</b> Here you can create a new image list which is pre-filled from the current
			list.</li>
		<li><b>Rename current image list:</b> Here you can change the name of the current image list.</li>
		<li><b>Backup image list:</b> Here you can backup any of your image lists. The backup is stored in the folder
			&ldquo;RandomImage&rdquo; of your phone memory, from where you may copy it to any other place.</li>
		<li><b>Restore image list:</b> Here you can restore any image list whose backup is located in the folder
			&ldquo;RandomImage&rdquo; of your phone memory.</li>
		<li><b>Delete image list:</b> Here you can delete any image list (except the current one). This is a permanent
			deletion, but you may restore it if you have a backup.</li>
		<li><b>Include other list in current list:</b> Here you can another image list to the current image list. This
			gives the possibility to combine multiple image lists into one bigger image list.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Included lists are displayed as a blue folder. If you make a long click on such a list, you may adjust how
		frequent images from this nested list are taken. In this way you may increase the display frequency of pictures from
		small lists.</p>

	<p>
		Without premium add-on, the icon <img src="../drawable/ic_action_folder.png" /> opens the setup menu.
	</p>

	<h3>Additional settings</h3>

	<p>
		While being on the image list configuration page, you can press the icon <img src="../drawable/ic_action_settings.png" />
		to go to the settings page. Here you find the following categories of settings:
	</p>

	<h4>Premium add-ons</h4>

	<p>You can purchase premium add-ons that enable the use of multiple image lists in the app.</p>

	<p>Currently, both premium add-ons are equivalent. The &ldquo;Premium plus&rdquo; add-on just gives additional
		appreciation to the developer of the app.</p>

	<p>On the long run, the &ldquo;Premium plus&rdquo; add-on will always enable all features of the app. Presumably,
		there will come new features which are not enabled by the &ldquo;Premium&rdquo; add-on. Therefore, the &ldquo;Premium
		plus&rdquo; add-on is a kind of flatrate for future app extensions.</p>

	<h4>Support</h4>

	<p>Here you can open this help page, make a PayPal donation to the developer, or contact the developer via email.</p>

	<h4>Other settings</h4>

	<ul>
		<li><b>Folder selection:</b> Here you can select between three different mechanisms to add images and folders:
			<ul>
				<li><b>List of image folders (default):</b> Here you get the list of all image folders displayed and can select
					from this list. This is the easiest option if you have few image folders.</li>
				<li><b>File browser:</b> Here you can select your image folders in a file browser. This is most practical if
					you have many image folders organized in the file system.</li>
				<li><b>Gallery:</b> Here you can select the image folder via the Gallery app. This may be helpful if you find
					your images easiest in the gallery.</li>
			</ul></li>
		<li><b>Language:</b> Change the language of the app. (Currently supported: English and German)</li>
		<li><b>Display all info messages:</b> There are various info messages in the app which you may disable by
			pressing the button &ldquo;Do not show again&rdquo;. The button &ldquo;Display all info messages&rdquo; re-enables
			all these messages.</li>
		<li><b>Do not display info messages:</b> This disables all kinds of info messages which otherwise need to be
			switched off individually. This is helpful for experienced users who install the app on a new device.</li>
	</ul>
