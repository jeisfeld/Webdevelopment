	<h2>Surprise Image - Overview</h2>

	<p>You have lots of great digital photos, but no time so see them? Then you need this app!</p>

	<p>This app allows you to select an arbitrary number of images that are stored on your smartphone (or tablet,
		including SD card) into a list, and then, whenever you want, to get one random photo out of your list displayed.</p>

	<p>This does not sound like a great thing, but believe me - it can bring you lots of happy moments! You just have
		to organize many pleasing pictures into your surprise image list.</p>

	<p>For example, you may surprise yourself each day</p>
	<ul>
		<li>with a photo of your sweetheart</li>
		<li>with a photo of your last big vacation</li>
		<li>with a photo of your children when they were young</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Just select any photos that make you happy!</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Add images from the gallery to your surprise image list</li>
		<li>Display an arbitrary photo from the list on full screen size</li>
		<li>Zoom the displayed image or switch to another surprise image</li>
		<li>Place a widget on your home screen that displays a new surprise image in regular time intervals</li>
		<li>Remove images from the list</li>
